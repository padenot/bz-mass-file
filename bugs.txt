Allow a setTargetAtTime TimeConstant to be 0
The formula when the time constant is pretty well-defined if the limit is taken, so no text is added to indicate what happens.

Allow delaying the first state transition of an `AudioContext` to prevent audio playing before user interaction.
We should talk with playback people about this, maybe they are doing something about HTMLMediaElement.

Allow collecting MediaStreamAudioSourceNode or MediaElementAudioSourceNode when they won't play ever again.
We need to check exactly what we are doing here

Reset AnalyserNodes when their fftSize attribute is changed.
If the fftSize is changed, reset the internal state for the FFT computations as if a new AnalyserNode were created.

Implement `cancelAndHoldAtTime`.
This allows authors to prevent sudden jump in param values.

Implement ConstantSourceNode
This is an AudioNode that outputs the value of its AudioParam.

In automation methods, when startTime is < AudioContext.currentTime, clamp to AudioContext.currentTime.
This allow to compensate for delays in thread communication, amongst other things.

When calling `decodeAudioData` on a detached `ArrayBuffer`, throw.
We kind of do this already, but we could throw much earlier.

Make setting the `value` attribute of an `AudioParam` strictly equivalent of calling setValueAtTime with AudioContext.currentTime.
This is kind of a breaking change, but simplifies the whole mode.

Specify behavior of setValueCurveAtTime
`setValueCurveAtTime` is modified so that an implicit call to `setValueAtTime` is made at the end of the curve duration.  This makes any following automation events start from the end of the `setValueCurveAtTime` event with the last value of the curve.

`setValueCurve` should throw on non-finite elements.
If the curve contains non-finite values, setValueCurveAtTime must signal a TypeError.  These values are illegal.

Implement negative playbackRate for AudioBufferSourceNode
This simply plays the buffer backward at a rate corresponding to the absolute value of the playbackRate.

Add latency metrics to the AudioContext
This allows computing the drift between the audio thread and the main thread, to synchronize audio and visuals for example.
